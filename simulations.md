# Simulations

## normal distribution
1. plot pdf of `normal(0,1)`, `normal(0, 4)`, `normal(2, 4)`, etc.
2. draw samples from each of the pdfs
3. plot histograms of each of the sample sets

## mean estimation and its distribution
1. random sampling from `normal(0,1)`
2. plot histogram
3. compute mean of the samples
4. repeat mean computation
